# vertical_tracing

This is the centroid algorithm aiming to tracing the vertical axons in cross-sectional spinal cord tissue. 
The neurite_tracing2.m script traces axonal pathways within 40 micrometers. 
The debug_tracing2.m is the inspection script that draws every image layer along with the searching box and seed points. 
MATLAB function dynamic_searching.m is the major function to conduct the centroid tracing. 
The script branch_test.m tests the axon branching tracing and connect2Section.m connects two tissue slices.
